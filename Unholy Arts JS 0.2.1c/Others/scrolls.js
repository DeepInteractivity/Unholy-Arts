A living being's vital aether is constantly gained and lost in small quantities, when it absorbs natural aether or its vital aether turns back into natural aether.

Most Gaanidan and Ashwalker families are started with the union of one man and one woman, in the case of the former they last for the rest of their lives and they often limit sexual activities to those with that one partner, while the latter are much more flexible in both aspects, but it is suspected that Ashwalkers used to follow customs similar to the Gaanidan ones ages ago, when they hadn't been for long in the Valley.\n\n"

The size of these families mostly depend on the capacity and resolve of this leading figure, and the average would be a couple dozens of members per family. When a Leirien reaches maturity, they leave their family and join a different one.\n\n"

Before this, they didn't have any standard model of family, and each person decided what kind of family they wanted to form a part of at any given stage of their lives and tried to act accordingly.\n\n"
				+ "The most peculiar situation is perhaps that of the Shapeshifters, who have no families at all, or perhaps they have one single family, composed by every member of their tribe. This could be related to how unique is the Shapeshifter birth, which takes place in large bodies of water where these peoples have sex with frequency, after unclear and perhaps variable amounts of time since the presumed conception, a process that makes it impossible to determine a Shapeshifter's parents.";
